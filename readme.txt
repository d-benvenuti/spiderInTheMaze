"Almost Pacman" is a simple project, built to show how some of the most important
features in the interactive graphics’ field can be handled with WebGl. The goal of the project
was to build something similar to a simple video game, in which the user can move its character
in a maze, trying to collect objectives. The final result is much more like a prototype than
a fully developed video game, but in its simplicity it accurately shows the challenges that
developers would encounter if graphic engines would not have existed. Everything was built
in native Javascript and HTML, with the aid of WebGl only, from scene organization, to
collisions detection, movement, animations and cameras. In its roughness, the project can
easily be improved, adding real 3d models, shadows, various levels and game modes, in order
to make it a real video game.
